Clear your temp files on local network computers and on a domain.

8 files are here.

Local (or otherwise known as Home Networks) scripts
Win7-local-clean-tmpfiles.ps1
  A long written script to clear temporary files from local network systems.

Win7-local-cleantmpfiles.ps1
  A shorter, and in my opinion cleaner, powershell script to clear temporary files from local network systems.
  
Win10-local-clean-tmpfiles.ps1
Win10-local-cleantmpfiles.ps1
  Same as the two windows 7 scripts.
  
Domain scripts
Win7-domain-clean-tmpfiles.ps1 \n
  A long written script to clear temporary files from domain connected systems.

Win7-domain-cleantmpfiles.ps1
  Same as the local powershell script, cleaner and more pretty looking script to clear temporary files from domain connected systems.
  
Win10-domain-clean-tmpfiles.ps1
Win10-domain-cleantmpfiles.ps1
  Same as above but for Windows 10 systems.
