Clear your temp files on local network computers and on a domain.<br />
<br />
8 files are here.<br />
<br />
Local (or otherwise known as Home Network) scripts <br />
Win7-local-clean-tmpfiles.ps1<br />
  A long written script to clear temporary files from local network systems.<br />
<br />
Win7-local-cleantmpfiles.ps1<br />
  A shorter, and in my opinion cleaner, powershell script to clear temporary files from local network systems.<br />
  <br />
Win10-local-clean-tmpfiles.ps1<br />
Win10-local-cleantmpfiles.ps1<br />
  Same as the two Windows 7 scripts but for Windows 10.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
Domain scripts<br />
Win7-domain-clean-tmpfiles.ps1<br />
  A long written script to clear temporary files from domain connected systems.<br />
<br />
Win7-domain-cleantmpfiles.ps1<br />
  Same as the local powershell script, cleaner and more pretty looking script to clear temporary files from domain connected systems.<br />
  
Win10-domain-clean-tmpfiles.ps1<br />
Win10-domain-cleantmpfiles.ps1<br />
  Same as above but for Windows 10 systems.
